    <p>
      Sylvite is a <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client">Kinesis Client Library (KCL)</a> multi-lang deamon runner.  The multi-lang deamon allows
      non-Java code to process a Kinesis stream, while still benefiting from the checkpointing, resharding, load balancing and
      monitoring capabilities provided by the KCL.

    <p>
      Sylvite is a lightweight wrapper around the KCL which makes it easier to package and deploy multi-lang processors.  One could
      say it feels much more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvite">natural</a> than the KCL.
